# Project-3 - Seam-Curving

Seam carving changes the size of an image by removing the least visible pixels in the image. The 
visibility of a pixel can be defined using an energy function. Seam carving can be done by finding a one-
pixel wide path of lowest energy crossing the image from top to bottom (vertical path) or from left to 
right (horizontal path) and removing the path (seam).
